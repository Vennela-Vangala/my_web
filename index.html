                <p>
                    Hi, I'm <strong>Vennela</strong>, a passionate and driven Computer Science Engineering student with a keen interest in <strong>technology, event management, and creative design</strong>. I thrive on <strong>solving problems, leading teams, and bringing innovative ideas to life</strong>.
                    With experience in <strong>data analysis, email marketing, and content creation</strong>, I am constantly exploring new ways to merge my technical expertise with my creativity. As a <strong>class representative and coordinator for training & placements</strong>, I have honed my <strong>leadership, communication, and organizational skills</strong>.
                    Apart from my academic pursuits, I am an aspiring <strong>entrepreneur</strong> working on launching my own <strong>event management startup</strong>. I believe in the power of <strong>designing unforgettable experiences</strong>, and I am committed to creating events that are as unique as the people they celebrate.
                    I am also deeply interested in <strong>mental health awareness and AI applications in security and wellness</strong>. My projects, such as <strong>Mental Health Prediction Using AI</strong> and <strong>AI-based Home Security System</strong>, reflect my passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.
                    Whether it's <strong>writing, fitness, negotiation strategies, or coding</strong>, I am always eager to learn, grow, and push my limits. Let's connect and build something impactful together!
